          Ally is an expert app for job seekers searching for quick industry specific insights and actionable advice when applying for the job of their dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a project that I developed during my User Experience Design course at Career Foundry. The work started in January 2020. The deliverables were ready for handoff in May same year.

        <h2>My approach</h2>
        <p>
          During the course of the project I was following user-centered design framework that allowed me to organize and plan my tasks without losing focus on the problem and the user.
        </p>
        <div class="">

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            An important step in the process was to get familiarized with <b>competitors on the market</b> and understand their approach to online advisory. I’ve looked at two applications: Quikconsult and JustAnswer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, it was time to <b>interview potential users</b> and gather their needs and information about their behaviors. I recruited people who fitted the user profile, that is were actively looking for job opportunities or looked for jobs in
            the past three months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Top actionable insights from the interviews:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>people were most interested in consulting with industry practitioners or recruiters, rather than career coaches</li>
            <li>people need both written way of communication such as messages or chat and verbal communication phone calls or video conferences</li>
            <li>people want quick and easy access to consultation, so well functioning and intuitive search functionality is crucial</li>
            <li>people most value years of experience, expertise and price rate as choice factors
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="">

          <h3>Define the user</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the data collected and patterns observed I prepared two user <b>personas</b> who would accompany me throughout the design process. Meet one of them - Julia.
          </p>

          <h3>Sitemap</h3>
          <p>
            Next, I started thinking about the IA of the and drew a draft sitemap. Afterwards, my initial thoughts were then taken to the test with open card sorting exercise. I asked participants to arrange categories from the draft sitemap into
            groups. I used the patterns that emerged from the exercise to alter the sitemap where it appeared useful or in some places even necessary. Below is the revised version of the sitemap.

          <h3>Low- to mid-fidelity wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            After grinding through ideas it was time to put pen to paper and start working on sketches and low-fidelity prototype to collect rough drafts of content layouts.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/ally/sketches/low-fi-prototype-1200.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/ally/sketches/low-fi-prototype.jpg" alt="Screen sketches">
          </picture>
          <p>
            Conceptual low-fidelity wireframes served as a basis for creating mid-fidelity wireframes with Adobe XD. Later, using the wireframes, I drew out the interactions and supplemented them with annotations that served as a static prototype.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/ally/mid-fi/mid-fi-wireframes-1200.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </picture>
          <p>
            After modifying some details and increasing the fidelity of my wireframes, I started setting up interactions for a clickable prototype to use it for testing.
            At the end of this phase, there were three features ready for testing: send a message to an expert, set up a payment method and book a call with an expert.
            Review the prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/d3230e2f-038e-4c4f-5a4a-a44012a6f9a4-a512/?fullscreen" target="_blank">here</a>

          <h3>Usability testing</h3>
          <p>
            After setting up the interactive prototype in the previous phase, I have started planning for usability testing sessions to check the learnability of the main features of the app. I started with recruiting participants, who, similarly as
            for user interviews’, were looking for a new job at the time or have been in the process in the past few months.
          </p>

          </picture>
          <p>
            After I ran the test with all participants, I analyzed the notes and recordings from the sessions using affinity mapping to discover patterns and themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most urgent issues for immediate redesign:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>chat messages not available from expert profile page,</li>
            <li>payments are difficult to spot in the account menu,</li>
            <li>there is no possibility to select time zone in the call booking flow,</li>
            <li>call fee not pronounced enough, users were surprised or frustrated,</li>
            <li>users expected to be able to add a new call without having to visit expert profile.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Visual design</h3>
          <p>
            Having fixed the top usability issues and some other minor problems, I have set off to refine the UI of the design. The works included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>applying 12-column grid layout that’s comfortable for responsible design work,</li>
            <li>reviewing the design with consideration to Gestalt laws of grouping and the principles of visual design,</li>
            <li>preference testing to support design choices,</li>
            <li>preparing a style guide,</li>
            <li>and, finally, a polished prototype for further rounds of reviews.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Final prototype</h3>
          <p>
            Having iterated on the design after the peers reviews and accessibility corrections, I set up the final prototype for this training project. There were three features developed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>send a message to an expert</li>
            <li>set up a payment method</li>
            <li>book a call with an expert</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <p>
          Preparing this case study was a perfect opportunity to take a moment and evaluate the successes of the project, as well as identify the areas for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was positively surprised with how easy it was to conduct the usability testing thanks to well prepared script and tasks. I also spent a lot of time studying the script, so that I don’t have to focus on it as much during the sessions. That
          allowed me to better concentrate on the participants and follow how they interacted with the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple rounds of iterations on the prototypes, provoked by tutor/mentor feedback, testing or peer review, greatly helped with evolution of the product. Receiving critical feedback turned out to be very motivational for me and helped my
          creative process.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, I see some potential for improvement with the way I conducted initial user interviews. At times, I focused on noting down what the participants were saying to such extent that I missed the meaning of the comments and
          failed to follow up on important remarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, to not have to worry about missing any important point, I’d use recording software on top of taking notes. That will allow me to ask follow-up questions, and gain more insights for the ideation phase.
