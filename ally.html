          Ally is an expert app for job seekers searching for quick industry specific insights and actionable advice when applying for the job of their dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a project that I developed during my User Experience Design course at Career Foundry. The work started in January 2020. The deliverables were ready for handoff in May same year.

        <h2>My approach</h2>
        <p>
          During the course of the project I was following user-centered design framework that allowed me to organize and plan my tasks without losing focus on the problem and the user.
        </p>
        <div class="">

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            An important step in the process was to get familiarized with <b>competitors on the market</b> and understand their approach to online advisory. Iâ€™ve looked at two applications: Quikconsult and JustAnswer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, it was time to <b>interview potential users</b> and gather their needs and information about their behaviors. I recruited people who fitted the user profile, that is were actively looking for job opportunities or looked for jobs in
            the past three months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Top actionable insights from the interviews:
          <ul>
            <li>people were most interested in consulting with industry practitioners or recruiters, rather than career coaches</li>
            <li>people need both written way of communication such as messages or chat and verbal communication phone calls or video conferences</li>
            <li>people want quick and easy access to consultation, so well functioning and intuitive search functionality is crucial</li>
            <li>people most value years of experience, expertise and price rate as choice factors
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Define the user</h3>
          <p>
Based on the data collected and patterns observed I prepared two user <b>personas</b> who would accompany me throughout the design process. Meet one of them - Julia.

          <h3>Sitemap</h3>
          <p>
Next, I started thinking about the IA of the and drew a draft sitemap. Afterwards, my initial thoughts were then taken to the test with open card sorting exercise. I asked participants to arrange categories from the draft sitemap into groups. I used the patterns that emerged from the exercise to alter the sitemap where it appeared useful or in some places even necessary. Below is the revised version of the sitemap.

          <h3>Low- to mid-fidelity wireframes</h3>
          <p>
After grinding through ideas it was time to put pen to paper and start working on sketches and low-fidelity prototype to collect rough drafts of content layouts.
          </p>

          </picture>
          <p>
Conceptual low-fidelity wireframes served as a basis for creating mid-fidelity wireframes with Adobe XD. Later, using the wireframes, I drew out the interactions and supplemented them with annotations that served as a static prototype.
          </p>

          </picture>
          <p>
            After modifying some details and increasing the fidelity of my wireframes, I started setting up interactions for a clickable prototype to use it for testing.
            At the end of this phase, there were three features ready for testing: send a message to an expert, set up a payment method and book a call with an expert.
